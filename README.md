# Listing GitHub Repos
This project was developed by studying and following [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)'s GoStack10 bootcamp lessons.

## Sumary
This ReactJS app covers how to integrate with GitHub API in order to display a list of repositories.
The app stores the name of the repository provided by the user inside LocalStorage, retrieves the data from the GitHub API and updates the interface.
By clicking on an item in the list, the user is sent to a page where detailed info for the repo he chose  is then to the display of more detailed information about it. We pass the reference of this posit√≥rio as a URL parameter through navigation and consult the GitHub API again to obtain the repository data and its issues.
